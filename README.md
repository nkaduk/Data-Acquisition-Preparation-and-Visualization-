# Data-Acquisition-Preparation-and-Visualization
R code (including labs) and PDF reports for the class I took Spring 2024 called Data Acqusition, Preperation and Visualization.  This is not comprehensive, as the course also went into depth with Excel, SAS, and Tableau.  However, the final project incorporated the majority of this class, so the final report has all aspects from these areas.
